### **Option 1: Using Maven Command Line**
```bash
mvn test
```

### **Option 2: Using an IDE**
- Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
- Run the Cucumber test runner class directly from the IDE.

---

## 🛠️ **Jenkins Integration**
1. **Setup Jenkins Job**:
   - Configure a new **Freestyle** or **Pipeline** project.
   - Add a build step to execute Maven with the goal `clean test`.

2. **View Test Reports**:
   - Integrate Cucumber Reports Plugin in Jenkins.
   - Access test execution results directly from Jenkins.

---

## 🧠 **Tips for Success**
- Keep ChromeDriver updated to avoid WebDriver exceptions.
- Regularly update project dependencies (`mvn dependency:resolve`).
- Use **tags** in Cucumber feature files to run specific test sets.
